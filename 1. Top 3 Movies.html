    <h1>The best movies according to Mridul</h1>
    <h2>My Top 3 of all time: </h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Munna Bhai</h3>
    <p>Both the movies Munna Bhai MBBS and Lage Raho Munna Bhai are brilliant. <br> They are so entertaining with a social message.</p>
    <h3>Conjuring 2</h3>
    <p>VALAK is supercool, it was the last movie that scared me after this all ghosts felt dumb and funny.</p>
    <h3>The Mummy</h3>
    <p>The all time best movie. OG Brandon Fraser. The movie is the best in this genre and no other Mummy movie could be so good. <br> And the climax battle was another level.</p>
